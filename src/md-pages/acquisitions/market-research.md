## Market Research

### GSA's Market Research as a Service (M-RAS) Tool

Market Research as a Service (M-RAS) utilizes the latest research techniques to collect requirement based data to help customers understand where their need fits within the GSA government-wide marketplaces. M-RAS involves obtaining information specific to the GSA product or service being acquired to satisfy your agency requirement. GSA offers this value-added service at no cost to your agency.

To initiate Market Research as a Service:

- **Engage your CSD:** Contact your [Customer Service Director (CSD)](http://gsa.gov/csd) to guide you through this process.
- **Request RFI from M-RAS team:** The CSD will fill out a short questionnaire so that the M-RAS team can create an RFI.

After the CSD or agency fills out the questionnaire, GSA will publish a market research RFI on the behalf of the customer agency. GSA will then collect and collate the results and deliver a report.

The report will usually answer the following:

- How many vendors are capable to perform your desired work and in a position to bid on your agency's project?
- What GSA contracts can these vendors be found on? 
- What are the socio-economic profiles of respondents across all GSA schedules and contracts?
