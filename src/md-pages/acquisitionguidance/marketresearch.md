## Market Research

### GSA's Market Research as a Service (MRAS) Tool

After an agency fills out a short questionnaire, GSA will publish a market research RFI on its behalf.  GSA will then collect and collate the results and deliver a report.

The report will usually answer the following:

- How many vendors are capable to perform your desired work and in a position to bid on your agency's project?
- What contracts can these vendors be found on?
- What are the socioeconomic profiles of respondents across all schedules and contracts?
