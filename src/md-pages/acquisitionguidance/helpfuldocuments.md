**SLA Standardization**

OMB MAX document library showcasing work centered around leveraging ISO/IEC 19086-2:2018 Cloud computing -- Service level agreement (SLA) framework. 

"The United States Government (USG) is looking to develop a catalog of standardized metrics for SLAs that can be used by all Federal Agencies for commercial cloud contracts. These metrics will be available as guidance for Federal Agencies and will not be mandatory. [...] As a customer, the USG sees the virtue and value in having standardized expressions that can be compared between vendors. As SLAs are a fundamental part of a cloud service contract, it is imperative that there is an efficient mechanism to compare SLA offerings. Cloud services that might seem comparable at first glance, might meet very different business objectives based on the guarantees offered by the underlying SLAs. While this might seem at first to be solely to the benefit of the customer, standardized expressions will not only allow Cloud Service Providers being able to differentiate their services based on their SLA, but will also lead to better informed contracts on both sides with fewer areas of potential misunderstandings on the part of the stakeholders."
