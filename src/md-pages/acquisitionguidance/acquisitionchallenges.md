Over the past year, we have identified common acquisition challenges related to acquiring cloud products and services with the help from Federal Agency and industry stakeholders. We encourage you to review and understand these acquisition challenges as you start the process of acquiring cloud products and services within your own Agency. Our goal is to continuously develop solutions for each of these common challenges and share them with all of you.

1. **Color of Appropriated funds for Continuous Flow of cloud service consumption**

With the consumption of services the government is driven to use Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funds per policy. O&M funding is one year money and needs to be obligated to an acquisition (e.g., contract, procurement) prior to the end of the Fiscal Year (FY). Flexibility to obligate funds beyond end of FY is difficult if legally allowed. With Continuing Resolutions (CRs) become the funding norm at the beginning of each new FY it is difficult to have O&M funding available. Do we need special definition of funding that can be flexible across the FY changes? This will become more of a factor the closer we get to true consumable services and not one year term licensing.

2. **Metered Services, Pay as you Go billing**

One of the five NIST essential characteristics for a commodity to be "cloud" requires that the commodity has some fidelity of consumption metering so that the government's cost can fluctuate based on actual periodic consumption. Many vendors are selling "cloud" type commodities that do not provide a high degree of metering and some require a fixed price for a minimum of one year.

3. **Service VS. Product Distinctions**

Many "cloud" software type offers were previously clearly products under any definition. The NIST definition of "cloud" defines these offers as services, which implicates different rules and regulations. Task Orders (TOs) are used for services while Delivery Orders (DOs) are used for products. Some of the service regulations are not a good fit for Cloud. As one example, the NAICs codes that are used for service providers do not fit well for the companies that provide cloud commodities. Another example requires products to be paid for in advance, while services must be paid for in arrears. Currently, many cloud resellers are selling their services via gift card which is paid for in advance - which is likely against the spirit of the regulations.

4. **Management of Consumables as a Service (should this title be governance instead?)**

How should the government manage the consumption of IT services, by the month, day, hour, minute? Where does the burden of that measurement cost more than purchasing these services in larger more manageable increments? What is that point of diminishing returns. How consistent are the different vendor charge mechanisms? Is it managed at the IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS level? How will the security of the infrastructure impede the ability to manage at this granular of a level?

5. **FAR Constraints**

The potential disconnect between treating cloud offers as either products or services leads to a host of complications because not all vendors align their offers to the Government's desired buying approach. As one example, the difficulty of treating the commodity as a service vs. a product creates difficulty for Contracting Officers (CO) in determining payment options and contract types. Vendors are likewise creatively characterizing their offers to help best fit the demands of Contract Officers, whether they truly fit commercial consumption models.

6. **Lack of Industry Standard**

Cloud computing has no dedicated international standard and few conventional standards across vendors and the industry. Some of the existing challenges are the differences among cloud models, how the industry is organized, pricing practices, data rights, service definitions, and security

7. **Common Terms & Conditions**

Acquiring these services needs to be made consistent across the government.

8. **Consumers need of Bounds of usage**

The government will need to be given some bounds for consuming of IT services such that the government can effectively manage cost and contractual obligations for the purchase of these services. Some standards must be communicated so that overruns in usage will be avoided or controlled prior to potential breach. If given the perception that they have unlimited usage rights to the services, abuse will naturally occur without proper throttling or management.

9. **Data Rights**

Government customers concerned about the ability to maintain their data in a hosted solution that they do not control. How to ensure that the Gov't owned data is always available in the future and can be potentially ported to another system. It is critical to ensure that the agency acquiring cloud services retains ownership to the data it stores and the rights to access, modify, or migrate that data if and when it chooses. Such an agreement ensures that the Government can select and migrate to another CSP if it is not satisfied with the services it receives. This point must always be made clear with the CSP prior to the acquisition and specified in writing in the final contract.

10. **Appropriate Contract Types to protect Government**

Typically Total Costs of Ownership (TCO) models do not fit well because they do not take into account the cost offsets of replacing legacy infrastructure and personnel. In other scenarios, they do not take in the potential additional cost of running two parallel systems for a period of time while a new system and legacy system run at the same time.

11. **Total Cost of Ownership**

The total cost of ownership is hard to calculate. Typically TCO models do not fit well because they do not take into account the cost offsets of replacing legacy infrastructure and personnel. In other scenarios, they do not take in the potential additional cost of running two parallel systems for a period of time while a new system and legacy system run at the same time.

12. **Legacy Application Migration**

The ability to buy a new cloud service is only a small part of the project. If the service to be acquired are intended to replace a legacy application, there is an enormous amount of considerations and planning required. Often this may take the form of a completely separate contract from a system integrator type contractor. Cloud providers are not typically in the best position to oversee a migration.
