        <h3>Updates:</h3>
<p>To assist agencies in their COVID-19 response efforts, GSA has negotiated an Amendment to the User Agreement with CarrierX, LLC and FreeConferenceCall.com that will allow Government Users the ability to use these services to support required increased telework.  This Amendment negotiated by GSA ensures that government agencies choosing to take advantage of this no-cost service are in compliance with FAR and other regulations.  For more information <a href="https://www.freeconferencecall.com/terms-and-conditions-us-gov-agencies">Click Here</a></p>    
 <p><b>Note:</b> These services and/or products are not endorsed by GSA. Government Users should coordinate with their appropriate agency offices (e.g., IT, Operational Security) to ensure compliance with agency policies prior to use. </p>     </div>
